# CatGameJam
## this is my first game jam
### ideas:
* enemy cats come from all around,and you must defend (object that cats like, tbd)
* longer survival = higher schore and more enemies spawn.
* you tell cats where to stand by shining a laser pointer (different colours for different functionality, maybe different types of cats too)
* mirrors can reflect lasers
* 2.5d perspective similar to [pokemon](https://www.cheatcc.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/hlihv5wavbxbxxmcwg2w.jpg)
## big thanks to my best friend for music and art
